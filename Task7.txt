Reflection:
	
	I'll be somewhat brief. It took me around 5 hour to complete this lab. If I din't have migraine while doing it, it would probably
	only take me 3 hours or so to complete. A lot of the tasks being just redoing an old task but with pointers instead meant that
	most of it was just copy-pasting and then doing some small changes. Didn't really take that much effort.

	I would like a task where you, for example, input multiple words each stored in a char*, then making a sentence of them in a char 
	**, then having them stored in a monologue char***, etc. I straight up stole this from stackoverflow, but I belive that it would 
	give a better picture of what using pointers to pointers can be used for. Right now Task 4 required you to use double pointers for 
	a task that you've already completed before, so very clearly it's not required to get the desired result(except for complying to 
	the task). My point(er) is that that having a task that, instead of doing some small changes to an already completed task, you 
	instead use double pointers to solve a problem that can not be solved efficiently in ways we've already learned previously.
