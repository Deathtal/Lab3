Reflection:
	
	I'll be brief. It took me around 5 hour to complete this lab. If I din't have migraine while doing it, it would probably only take me 3 hours or so to complete. A lot of the tasks being just redoing an old task but with pointers instead meant that most of it is just copy-pasting and then doing some small changes. Didn't really take that much effort.

	Something I would've liked to see more of in this lab is using double pointers and such. I also would like to have better tasks that you need to use double pointers to achieve the correct result. There isn't really a reason to use double pointers when all you want is sort 3 values. If there is a good reason for it then I would like to know why.
	I would like a task where you input multiple words each stored in a char*, then making a sentence of them in a char **, then having a monologue char***, etc. I straight up stole this from stackoverflow, but I belive that it would give a better picture of what using pointers to pointers can be used for.
